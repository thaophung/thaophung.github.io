I'm a Ph.D. student in computer science at Auburn University, advised by [Wei-Shinn Ku][ku]. My research interestes focus on data management and machine learning. 

Before coming to Auburn, I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science from University of Wyoming. 

<!--I am currently looking for full-time positions in software engineering, data science, or related fields. I have professional experience with machine learning applications and cutting-edge research.-->

From 2016 to 2018, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant at [Evolving AI Lab][lab]. I worked with [Anh Nguyen][anh] in [learning to solve symbolic math from visual inputs][project], in which we studied if deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn to extract the meanings behind visual symbols.
