I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science from University of Wyoming in December 2018. 

<!--I am currently looking for full-time positions in software engineering, data science, or related fields. I have professional experience with machine learning applications and cutting-edge research.-->

From 2016 to 2018, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant at [Evolving AI Lab][lab]. I worked with [Anh Nguyen][anh] in [learning to solve symbolic math from visual inputs][project], in which we studied if deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn to extract the meanings behind visual symbols.
