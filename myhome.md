I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science at University of Wyoming in December 2018. I am currently looking for full-time positions in software engineering, data science, or related fields. I have professional experience with machine learning applications and cutting-edge research.

For the last 2.5 years (2016-2018), as an undergraduate research assistant at [Evolving AI Lab][lab], I worked with [Anh Nguyen][anh] in studying if deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn to extract the meanings behind visual symbols. In [Learning to Solve Symbolic Math from Visual Inputs project][project], we explored approaches to train DNNs to solve addition and subtraction problems from images of equations.
