<!--I'm a Ph.D. student in computer science at Auburn University, advised by [Wei-Shinn Ku][ku]. My research interests focus on data management and machine learning. 

Before coming to Auburn,I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science from University of Wyoming. -->

<!--I am currently looking for full-time positions in software engineering, data science, or related fields. I have professional experience with machine learning applications and cutting-edge research.-->

<!--During my undergraduate, I worked as a research assistant at [Evolving AI Lab][lab]. I worked with [Anh Nguyen][anh] in [learning to solve symbolic math from visual inputs][project], in which we studied if deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn to extract the meanings behind visual symbols.-->

Hello! I am Thao Phung, a PhD student in Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines. I am advised by [Dr. Tom Williams][tom] at the Mines Interactive Robotics Research Lab ([MIRRORLab][mirrorlab]). My current research interests include human-robot interaction, augmented reality.
