        American sign language (ASL) is used widely in the Deaf community. However, it is difficult for an ASL speaker and an English speaker to communicate and understand each other. Now, with the development of artificial intelligence and deep learning, we can solve this problem and help ASL and English speakers have better communication without professional help from human translators. Deep convolutional neural networks have achieved recent breakthroughs on a variety of image and video recognition tasks. Although these networks are not perfectly understood, they exhibit many convenient properties such as translation invariance that make them robust to noise in tech feature space.
        I hand-designed 2860 videos for ASL alphabet including motion letters. Although the initial results yielded only 9.7% accuracy, this is higher than the 3% baseline accuracy obtained by random guessing.

       Deep neural networks (DNNs) have obtained the state-of-the-art performance on many challenging tasks by learning from only visual inputs such as recognizing and detecting objects from images, playing Atari games from the visual screen, predicting sounds from silent videos and even detecting cancers from medical scans. Given their impressive pattern recognition capability, can DNNs learn to extract the meanings behind visual symbols? In this research, we explore approaches to train DNNs to solve addition and subtraction problems from images of equations.

  - title: "Investigation on the Use of Perception Manipulation to Enhance Virtual Reality Training"

    skills: "Virtual Reality, C#, Unity, action-specific perception, presentation, technical writing"

        Prior psychology research has shown that as people perceive their performance on a task, their perception changes about the objects in the environment. For example, consider the sports scenario of hitting a baseball. If someone is doing really well at hitting the ball, then their perception of the size of ball is larger, or easier to hit. If they are not doing well, their perception of the size of ball is that it is smaller, or harder to hit. Virtual Reality (VR) has been shown to have benefit for training. To further this, what if we can use this perception phenomenon as a way to prime the individual in order to manipulate and improve performance, possibly resulting in better training as well. We are investigating the role of perception and the effects of using perception in virtual reality training on actual real world physical task performance.
